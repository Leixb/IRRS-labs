	abstract = {The Data Encryption Standard ({DES} ) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
Developed in the early 1970s at {IBM} and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards ({NBS}) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency ({NSA}), the {NBS} selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard ({FIPS}) for the United States in 1977.The publication of an {NSA}-approved encryption standard led to its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose from classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the {NSA}, raising suspicions about a backdoor.  The S-boxes that had prompted those suspicions were designed by the {NSA} to remove a backdoor they secretly knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the {NSA} also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced so that they could break the cipher by brute force attack. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.
{DES} is insecure due to the relatively short 56-bit key size. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a {DES} key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see chronology). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple {DES}, although there are theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard ({AES}). {DES} has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.Some documents distinguish between the {DES} standard and its algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the {DEA} (Data Encryption Algorithm).},
