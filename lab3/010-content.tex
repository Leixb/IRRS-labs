\section*{Implementation Challenges and Decisions}
The edge class was created to contains the required information for a route. it contains the origin of the route, the weight and a tuple with the origin and destination to identify it.
Adding the routes was done by filtering out the elements where departure or destination airport were missing, then adding them to our list and incrementing the weights.

We decided to have several parameters to compute the page rank algorithm:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
    \item \texttt{lambda} : the damping factor
    \item \texttt{maxIterations} : The maximum number of loops
    \item \texttt{atol} : The threshold at which we consider two matrix equals.
\end{itemize}


We decided to start with a initial uniform probability vector.
Then we applied the algorithm with the normalised weights and the chosen Lambda.

To analyse the result, we made another program to benchmark the algorithm with various values for lambda and atol the following section present them.

\section*{Results}

\Cref{fig:results_iter} shows the number of iterations for different
values of the damping factor $l$ and the tolerance $\epsilon$ for the
convergence criterion. Note that the vertical axis is logarithmic.
We can see that the number of iterations increases exponentially with
the damping factor. And that the tolerance has a multiplicative effect
on the number of iterations, the smaller the tolerance, the more
iterations we require. However, the damping factor has a much
stronger effect.

With damping factor $l=0.99$, we reach the maximum number of iterations
of 1000 we set on our experiments.

\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:results_pr} we show how the damping factor affects the distribution of values of the PageRank.
Once again, the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale to help distinguish the results.
We can observe that by increasing the damping factor, the value of the highest Page ranks increases while
the median and lower values of PageRank decrease. Additionally, there is in increase of the variability
in the distribution of PageRank when we increase the damping factor.

\Cref{tab:top20} represents the results obtained with our program and the default parameters $\lambda = 0.9,\; \texttt{atol} = 10^{-10}$). we observed that the value of $\lambda$ affects the results, specially with lower
values. With higher values the change is less noticeable:
%The result vary a little when changing them
(for example with lambda = 0.8 the top 3 is \texttt{LAX}, \texttt{ORD}, \texttt{DEN})%
\footnote{The results can be found in \cref{ap:out}}
but overall are showing the same trend.
