\section*{Conclusions}

We have implemented a MapReduce \emph{K-means} for documents in Python and tested it
with the \emph{arXiv-abs} dataset. We have found that the algorithm is
parallelizable using map-reduce and that the higher the size of the vocabulary, the
better it parallelizes. The algorithm is very sensitive to the set of words
used for computing the distances. Despite trying lots of different ranges of word frequencies it
we did not converge to more than 3 clusters in any case.

This is probably due to the fact that the method of choosing the words from the frequency list
is not the best one since it is difficult to isolate words related to specific fields of study.
Other metrics such as \emph{TF-IDF} could be used to improve the results.
